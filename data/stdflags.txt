#? The list of standard Silico flags (i.e., those found in most Silico programs).

#. Standard Silico Flags:
#; -o_<format>	Output file format
#; -O_<file>	Output file name 
#; -nosort	Do not sort atoms before output
#; -notype	Do not type atoms before output
#; -fast	Fast write (equivalent to -nosort -notype)
#; -bond	Force regeneration of bond records
#; -nobond	Do not regenerate bond records
#; -noconect	Do not generate CONECT records for PDB output
#; -compress_<method>    Output file compression. Method = gz or bz2
#; --timing	Print more detailed timing information
#; --quiet	Quiet (suppress notes)
#; --very-quiet	Very quiet (suppress notes and warnings)
#; -debug	Write debugging messages
#
#
#. General flags implemented in some programs:
#; -me		Maximum energy relative to first structure
#; -ms		Maximum number of structures to read
#; -ss		Start reading from this structure
#; --stride_<n>   Read every nth structure from file 
#; --unique-atom-names Make atom names in molecules unique
#
#. PDB file specific flags:
#; -dupconect	Represent multiple bonds using duplicated CONECT records in PDB output
#; -longres	Use 4 character residue names in pdb files
#
#. SD file specific flags:
#;  --sdf-2D	Force SDF files to 2D format
#;  --sdf-3D	Force SDF files to 3D format
#;  --sdf-squash-hcount  Do not write any values to the SDF hcount field
#
#. Gaussian and Gamess specific flags:
#; --last-structure Retain only the last read structure (implemented in read_gaussian and read_gamess)
