#!4  Atom specifier examples:
#; ANAME:CA All atoms called 'CA'.
#; ANAME:CA,CB,CG Returns all atoms called 'CA' or 'CB' or 'CD'.
#; ANAME:CA,RESNAME:TRP All atoms called 'CA' in all residues called TRP
#; ANAME:CA,SUBID:4 All atoms called 'CA' in residue number 4
#; ELEMENT:!H All nonhydrogen atoms
#; SEGID:PROT,SEGID:LIG All atoms with the SEGID set to PROT or LIG
#. Successive atom specifications can be made. Each is separated by a '|'
#; ANAME:CB|ANAME:CA|ANAME:CD Returns all atoms called 'CB', 'CA', 'CD'.
#; ANAME:CA,RESNUM:1|ANAME:CA,RESNUM:4 Returns 'CA' atoms from residue 1 and 4.
#. Atom specifiers are case sensitive.
