#! opls_amino_acid_atoms.dat
#? Data file containing mappings of amino acid atoms
#  to OPLS-AA atom types. This file assumes that atoms
#  have been named according to the standards in the file
#  amino_acids_smiles.dat (derived in turn from the PDB
#  standard).
#. Not all amino acid atoms have been included here; only those
#  with OPLS-AA types that would not otherwise be assigned to
#  them.
#. Hydrogens are not included.
