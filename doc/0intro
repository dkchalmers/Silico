#!1 Silico - A Perl Molecular Modelling Toolkit
#
#. Written by David Chalmers and Ben Roberts
#
#. Silico is a set of Perl libraries and scripts to assist with molecular modelling tasks. Capablilities include
#  molecule and model system construction, format interconversion, molecular rotations and translations, 
#  atom and substructure naming, functional group identification or acting as a wrapper script for other software.
# 
#!2 Installation
# 
#. Download Silico from Github
#
#c  git clone git@github.com:dkchalmers/Silico.git
#
#. Silico is organised as a single directory tree:
#; bin Containing the executable scripts
#; data Atom types, boilerplate text describing silico flags, etc.
#; doc Documentation
#; lib Library files containing silico subroutines
#; test Directory with test files
#  
#. Silico needs the environment variable $SILICO_HOME to point to the top level Silico directory. 
#  Add the $SILICO_HOME/bin directory to your path.
# 
#. csh
#
#c setenv SILICO_HOME  /path/to/Silico
#c setenv PATH $PATH\:$SILICO_HOME/bin
# 
#.  bash
#
#c export SILICO_HOME=/path/to/Silico
#c export PATH="$PATH:$SILICO_HOME/bin"
# 
#!2 Using Silico scripts
# 
#. Silico scripts use the general form:
# 
#. scriptname <flags> filename1 filename2 ....
# 
#. Flags start with a the character '-'. For example, the command
# 
#c write_mol -o mol2 $SILICO_HOME/test/molecules/tricycle_3D.sdf 
# 
#. will read the file 'tricycle_3D.sdf', set the -o flag (output format) to mol2. The result will be a new 
#  output file 'tricycle_3D_new.mol2'.
# 
#!3 Universal Silico flags
#  
#. While most flags are specific to a script several flags are handled in 
#  the silico_io module and operate in all Silico scripts.  These are:
#
#; -help Print out the documenation present in the script file
#; -m Prompt for all flags
# 
#!3 Common Silico flags
# 
#. These flags are available in many Silico scripts:
# 
#; -debug Print out debugging information
#; -nosort Do not change atom order
#; -noconnect Do not generate atom connectivites
#; -o Output file format.  For most formats this is the file extension. E.g. pdb, mol2, sdf.  
#; -O Output filename
# 
#!3 Support for large argument lists
#
#. Some Unix shells are limited by the number of arguments (files) that can be included on 
#  the command line.  Silico supports very large lists of input files by using 
#  Perl regular expressions to carry out its own wildcard matching.  To use this 
#  feature it is necessary to enclose the file argument in quotes (to escape shell
#  expansion).
#. Example: write_mol2 '*.pdb'
#. This command enables conversion of a very long list of pdb files to mol2 format.
#
#!3 Documentation
#
#. Silico scripts and libraries are documented within the source code.  The documentation
#  is marked up using a simple markup scheme (see silico_doc.pm) that can be 
#  converted to formatted ASCII text, markdown or HTML. Conversion routines are found in
#  silico_doc.pm.  The formatdoc script will perform the conversion for Silico files.
#  A complete set of documentation is generated by running the script 'doc/makedoc'.
#
#!3 Internal data structures
# 
#. Internally molecular structures are stored in ensembles, molecules and atoms:
#  
#!4 Atoms 
# 
#. Each atom is a Perl hash which can contain any desired fields.
#  The most important are:
#  
#; $atom->{NUM} Atom number
#; $atom->{NAME} Atom name
#; $atom->{SUBNAME} Residue name
#; $atom->{SUBID} Residue number
#; $atom->{X}    X coordinate
#; $atom->{Y}    Y coordinate
#; $atom->{Z}    Z coordinate
#; $atom->{ELEMENT}  Atom element
#; $atom->{ELEMENT_NUM} Atom element number 
#; $atom->{CONNECT} Pointer to array containing atom numbers of connected atoms
#; $atom->{BORDERS} Pointer to array containing orders of bonds to connected atoms
#
#!4 Molecules
#
#. Molecules are Perl hashes which contain attributes such as 
#  Name, Number of atoms and the collection of atom records in a hash.
#  Any desired field can be put into the hash but the most important are:  
# 
#; $mol->{ATOMS} Pointer to an array of atoms
#; $mol->{NAME} Molecule name
#; $mol->{NUMATOMS} Number of atoms.  Note: indexed from 1 rather than 0.
#; $mol->{NUMBONDS} Number of bonds.  Note: indexed from 1 rather than 0.
#  
#  
#!4 Ensembles
#. Ensembles are collections of molecules.  They are stored simply as Perl arrays of molecules and 
#  unlike molecules or atoms can contain no additional attributes
#. Ensembles are read from or written to output
#  files as multiple molecule files (mol2, sdf, mmod) or as separate MODELS
#  in a pdb file.
#
#!3 Scripts
#
#. The bin directory contains variety of scripts that have been written 
#  in the course of various projects. 
#
#!4 File format conversion scripts
#
#. A useful features of Silico is that it can read and write
#  files in many different molecular modelling formats. 
#  Silico (mostly) recognises the input file types by filename extension.
#  write_g03zmat  write_gro  write_itp  write_merck  write_mmod  write_mol  
#  write_mol2  write_mopac  write_pdb  write_sdf  write_seq  write_tab  write_tinker
#
#!4 Wrapper sripts for running other programs
#
#. Silico can be used to make wrappers to run other programs from the command line,
#  particularly when running series of programs.  An example is the script mmod_min
#  
#
#!4 Solvation scripts
#
#.  Basic solvation scripts include mol_solvate (to embed a molecule in a solvent box), 
#   mol_solvate_bilayer_plane (to place a molecule in a periodic bilayer plane) and 
#   mol_solvate_bilayer_rod (to place a periodic bilayer rod).


#
#!3 Caveats and notes
# 
#. Silico certainly contains bugs, definitions of 
#  things that may not be the best way to define things, inefficient 
#  algorithms, poor memory useage, and other things that can easily be 
#  fixed with the application of a lot of time and effort.

#.  Older iterations of silico were published on Sourceforge: sourceforge.net/projects/silico/
